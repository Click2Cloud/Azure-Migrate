# Java PetStore Assessment
## Purpose of this application:
Do you remember the good old Java Petstore ? It was a sample application created by Sun for its Java BluePrints program. The Java Petstore was designed to illustrate how J2EE (and then Java EE) could be used to develop an eCommerce web application. Yes, the point of the Petstore is to sell pets online. The idea was to build an application with a certain technology.


## Technologies used:
- **Technologies** : Java EE 7 (JPA 2.1, CDI 1.1, Bean Validation 1.1, EJB Lite 3.2, JSF 2.2, JAX-RS 2.0), Java SE 7 (because that's the minimum required by Java EE 7), Twitter Bootstrap (Bootstrap 3.x, JQuery 2.x, PrimeFaces 6.x)
- **Application Servers** : WildFly 10, WildFly 11
- **Database** : MySQL 5.7
- **Summary** : A Petstore-like application using Java EE 7
