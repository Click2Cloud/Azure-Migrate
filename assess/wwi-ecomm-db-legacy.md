# Wide World Importers legacy Database Assessment
* WWI has its own e-Commerce Platform where they sell WWI Brand Merchandise.
* This WWI is on on-premise infrastructure.
* WWI wants to migrate their workload on Azure cloud.

The database that will be migrated contains campaign related data and is hosted on Windows Server 2008 R2.

Technologies used:
 - Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2

## Steps for Application Dependency and Grouping

Dependency mapping helps you to visualize dependencies across machines. You typically use dependency mapping when you want to assess machine groups with higher levels of confidence.
- It helps you to cross-check machine dependencies, before you run an assessment.
- It also helps to effectively plan your migration to Azure, by ensuring that nothing is left behind, and thus avoiding surprise outages during migration.
- You can discover interdependent systems that need to migrate together, and identify whether a running system is still serving users, or is a candidate for decommissioning instead of migration.


### Agent-Based Dependency Visualization

> Steps for installing dependency agent on VMs can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/how-to-create-group-machine-dependencies)

1. Log in to the azure console, Search for **Azure Migrate** and click on **Azure Migrate**.

</kbd></p>

3. For Assessment In the **Servers** tab, in **Azure Migrate: Server Assessment** tile, click **Discovered servers**.

Here you can see all the discovered servers which Azure appliance has discovered.

1. In the **Dependencies** column, click **View dependencies** for each machine you want to review.
2. After you have identified the dependent machines on the dependency map that you want to group together, use Ctrl+Click to select multiple machines on the map, and click Group machines.

6. After the assessment is created, view it in **Servers** > **Azure Migrate: Server Assessment** > **Assessments**.  

    Each performance-based Azure VM assessment in Azure Migrate is associated with a confidence rating. The rating ranges from one (lowest) to five (highest) stars. The confidence rating helps you to estimate the reliability of the size recommendations Azure Migrate provides. Azure migrate recommends to perform assessment after 24 hours of discovery to get accurate and reliable assessment results.

    - The confidence rating is assigned to an assessment. The rating is based on the availability of data points that are needed to compute the assessment.
    - For performance-based sizing, Server Assessment needs:
      * The utilization data for CPU and VM RAM.
      * The disk IOPS and throughput data for every disk attached to the VM.
      * The network I/O to handle performance-based sizing for each network adapter attached to a VM.

9. Click on **Cost Details**.
It shows the estimated monthly compute and storage costs for running the VMs in Azure and Estimated costs for disk storage after migration.
