# Wide World Importers legacy Database Assessment
* WWI has its own e-Commerce Platform where they sell WWI Brand Merchandise.
* This WWI is on on-premise infrastructure.
* WWI wants to migrate their workload on Azure cloud.

The database that will be migrated contains campaign related data and is hosted on Windows Server 2008 R2.

Technologies used:
 - Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2

## Steps for Application Discovery

App discovery using Azure Migrate: Server Assessment is agentless. Nothing is installed on machines and VMs. Server Assessment uses the Azure Migrate appliance to perform discovery along with machine guest credentials. The appliance remotely accesses the VMware machines using VMware APIs.

1. Log in to the azure console, Search for **Azure Migrate** and click on **Azure Migrate**.

3. For Assessment In the **Servers** tab, in **Azure Migrate: Server Assessment** tile, click **Discovered servers**.

Here you can see all the discovered servers from your on-premise data center **vCenter** which Azure appliance has discovered.

6. After the assessment is created, view it in **Servers** > **Azure Migrate: Server Assessment** > **Assessments**.  

    Each performance-based Azure VM assessment in Azure Migrate is associated with a confidence rating. The rating ranges from one (lowest) to five (highest) stars. The confidence rating helps you to estimate the reliability of the size recommendations Azure Migrate provides. Azure migrate recommends to perform assessment after 24 hours of discovery to get accurate and reliable assessment results.

    - The confidence rating is assigned to an assessment. The rating is based on the availability of data points that are needed to compute the assessment.
    - For performance-based sizing, Server Assessment needs:
      * The utilization data for CPU and VM RAM.
      * The disk IOPS and throughput data for every disk attached to the VM.
      * The network I/O to handle performance-based sizing for each network adapter attached to a VM.
