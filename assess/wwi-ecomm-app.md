# Wide World Importers Application Assessment
* WWI has its own e-Commerce Platform where they sell WWI Brand Merchandise.
* This WWI is on on-premise infrastructure.
* WWI wants to migrate their workload on Azure cloud.

The application that will be migrated is hosted on a Windows server 2016 running Internet Information Services (IIS)

Technologies used:
 - .NET Core v2.2.104


## Steps to view discovered Virtual Machines

1. Log in to the azure console, Search for **Azure Migrate** and click on **Azure Migrate**.

</kbd></p>

3. For Assessment In the **Servers** tab, in **Azure Migrate: Server Assessment** tile, click **Discovered servers**.

Here you can see all the discovered servers from **Hyper-V** which Azure appliance has discovered.

## Steps for Application Dependency and Grouping

Dependency mapping helps you to visualize dependencies across machines. You typically use dependency mapping when you want to assess machine groups with higher levels of confidence.
- It helps you to cross-check machine dependencies, before you run an assessment.
- It also helps to effectively plan your migration to Azure, by ensuring that nothing is left behind, and thus avoiding surprise outages during migration.
- You can discover interdependent systems that need to migrate together, and identify whether a running system is still serving users, or is a candidate for decommissioning instead of migration.

Dependency Visualization can be done in two ways:
1. Agent-Based
2. Agentless

### Agent-Based Dependency Visualization

> Steps for installing dependency agent on VMs can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/how-to-create-group-machine-dependencies)

1. In the **Dependencies** column, click **View dependencies** for each machine you want to review.
2. After you have identified the dependent machines on the dependency map that you want to group together, use Ctrl+Click to select multiple machines on the map, and click Group machines.

* Application dependency for Windows VM (Application hosted on IIS - WWI e-Commerce)

### Agentless Dependency Visualization

1. In **Azure Migrate: Server Assessment**, click **Discovered servers**

<p><kbd>

</kbd></p>

2. Click to get the access of agentless dependency preview.

4. You will be redirected to **Azure Migrate**: **Server Assessment**.  
Click the **Dependency analysis** icon.  
Click **Add servers**.

5. Select the servers.  
Click **Add servers**.

6. You can visualize dependencies around six hours after starting dependency discovery.  
In the Dependencies column, click **View dependencies**.

## Steps for Azure Readiness and Total Cost of Ownership

1. In the **Servers** tab, in **Azure Migrate: Server Assessment** tile, click **Assess**.

<p><kbd>
  <img src="../images/WWI-eCommerce/wwi-server-assessment-3.png">
</kbd></p>

2. In **Assess servers**, select the assessment type as **Azure VM**, select the discovery source and specify the assessment name.

<p><kbd>

</kbd></p>

3. Select **View all**, and then review the assessment properties and click **Save**.

6. After the assessment is created, view it in **Servers** > **Azure Migrate: Server Assessment** > **Assessments**.  

    Each performance-based Azure VM assessment in Azure Migrate is associated with a confidence rating. The rating ranges from one (lowest) to five (highest) stars. The confidence rating helps you to estimate the reliability of the size recommendations Azure Migrate provides. Azure migrate recommends to performs assessment after 24 hours of discovery to get accurate and reliable assessment results.

    - The confidence rating is assigned to an assessment. The rating is based on the availability of data points that are needed to compute the assessment.
    - For performance-based sizing, Server Assessment needs:
      * The utilization data for CPU and VM RAM.
      * The disk IOPS and throughput data for every disk attached to the VM.
      * The network I/O to handle performance-based sizing for each network adapter attached to a VM.

## Steps for Application Assessment using Azure App Service Migration Assistant

The App Service Migration Assistant is designed to simplify your journey to the cloud through a free, simple, and fast solution to migrate .Net applications from on-premises to the cloud.

1. [Download](https://appmigration.microsoft.com/readiness) and open the Azure App Service Migration Assistant. Select the app for assessment and start the assessment.
