3. Create VM using the uploaded ISO file.

    **Procedure**

    </kbd></p> 
    
    10. The virtual machine appears in the vSphere Client inventory.
    
4. After the virtual machine is created, you will have to install Centos 7 (64 bit) OS on it.  
    **Installation Steps**
    1. Upon booting the **CentOS 7 ISO** file, you can begin the installation process. To do so, select **Install CentOS 7**. That will start the installer’s graphical interface.

    <p><kbd>
        <img src="../../images/prerequisites/centos/inst-1.png">
    </kbd></p>

    2. Before starting the installation process itself, select which language you would like to use during installation. **The default option is English.**

    <p><kbd>
        <img src="../../images/prerequisites/centos/inst-2.png">
    </kbd></p>

    3. **Click Continue** to confirm your selection.
    There are a couple of settings you would want to configure. All items marked with a warning icon must be configured before you begin the installation.

    <p><kbd>
        <img src="../../images/prerequisites/centos/inst-3.png">
    </kbd></p>

    4. **Set Date and Time** To set a date and time for the system, click the Date & Time icon under the Localization heading. Select a region/time zone on the map of the world as seen below. Once you have selected your time zone, hit **Done** to save your changes.

    <p><kbd>
        <img src="../../images/prerequisites/centos/inst-4.png">
    </kbd></p>

    5. **System Language** Next, select the Language Support option under the Localization heading. The language selected in the Welcome to CentOS 7 window will be the default system language. If necessary, select additional languages and hit the ***Done*** button once you are finished.

    <p><kbd>
        <img src="../../images/prerequisites/centos/inst-5.png">
    </kbd></p>

    6. **Software Selection** Select the Software Selection option under the Software heading. You will see a list of predefined Base Environment options and optional add-ons. This part entirely depends on your needs.
        - **Minimal Install.** This is the most flexible and least resource-demanding option. Excellent for production environment servers. Be prepared to customize the environment.
        - **Predefined Server Options.** If you are 100% certain about the role of your server and don’t want to customize it for its role, select one of the predefined server environments.
        - **GNOME Desktop and KDE Plasma Workspaces.** These environments include a full graphical user interface.
    
        When you have selected the base environment and optional add-ons, click the **Done** button. Wait for the system to check for software dependencies before you move on to the next option.
    
    <p><kbd>

    </kbd></p>

    7. **Select Installation Destination** Click the Installation Destination option under the System heading. Check your machine’s storage under the Local Standard Disks heading. *CentOS 7 will be installed on the selected disk.*
    
        **Partitioning**
        - **Option 1: Automatic Partitioning** Under the Other Storage Options heading, select the **Automatically configure partitioning checkbox**. This ensures the selected destination storage disk will automatically partition with the **/(root), /home and swap partitions**. It will automatically create an LVM logical volume in the **XFS file system**.
        If you do not have enough free space, you can reclaim disk space and instruct the system to delete files. When finished, click the **Done** button.
        - **Option 2: Manual Partitioning** Select the **I will configure partitioning checkbox** and choose **Done**. If you want to use other file systems **(such as ext4 and vfat)** and a non-LVM partitioning scheme, such as **btrfs**. This will initiate a configuration pop-up where you can set up your partitioning manually. This is an advanced setting option, very much based on your requirements.

    </kbd></p>

    9. **Select Configure…** and select to add IPv4 settings or IPv6 settings depending on what you have. Add **static IP addresses** to help identify your computer on the network. Bear in mind that your network environment’s settings define these values.
    
        **To add a static IP address**
        - Select **Manual** from the Method drop-down.
        - Click the **Add** button to add a static IP address.
        - Enter the information for your network domain.
            - IP Address
            - Netmask Address
            - Gateway Address
            - DNS Servers Address
        - Click **Save** to confirm your changes.

        By default, all detected Ethernet connections are disabled. Click the **ON/OFF** toggle to enable the connection.
