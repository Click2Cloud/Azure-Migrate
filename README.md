# Azure Migrate
**Azure Migrate** provides a centralized hub to **assess** and **migrate** to Azure on-premises servers, infrastructure, applications, and data.
## Azure Migrate provides the following features:
* **Unified migration platform:** A single portal to start, run, and track your migration to Azure.
* **Range of tools:** A range of tools for assessment and migration. Tools include Azure Migrate: Server Assessment and Azure Migrate: Server Migration. Azure Migrate integrates with other Azure services and with other tools and independent software vendor (ISV) offerings.
* **Assessment and migration:** In the Azure Migrate hub, you can assess and migrate:
    * **Servers:** Assess on-premises servers and migrate them to Azure virtual machines.
    * **Databases:** Assess on-premises databases and migrate them to Azure SQL Database or to an Azure SQL Database managed instance.
    * **Web applications:** Assess on-premises web applications and migrate them to Azure App Service by using the Azure App Service Migration Assistant.
    * **Virtual desktops:** Assess your on-premises virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) and migrate it to Windows Virtual Desktop in Azure.
    * **Data:** Migrate large amounts of data to Azure quickly and cost-effectively using Azure Data Box products.


## Scenario

</kbd></p>

### **1. Lift & Shift**
**Lift and shift**, also known as **rehosting**, is the process of migrating an exact copy of an application or workload (and its data store and OS) from IT one environment to another-usually from on-premises to public or private cloud.

- This demo will be focused on describing the Assessment and Migration of source Server on azure cloud. With enormous capability of **Azure Migrate**
- we can assess server which has any types of database which are pointing to any web application and Migrate them using Azure Migrate Migration Tool.
- Before migration server assessment is done using
    - Azure Migrate: Server Assessment
        >- Discover installed applications, roles, and features with the Server Assessment tool in Azure Migrate.
- After assessment server migration is done using
    - Azure Migrate: Server Migration
        >- Migrate VM-Ware VMs, Hyper-V VMs, physical servers, other virtualized machines, and public cloud VMs to Azure.

### **2. App Modernization**
Modernization is all about transforming your legacy, monolithic applications into something more agile, more elastic, and with higher availability.
A modernized, cloud hosted application drastically reduces hardware and infrastructure cost and at the same time can improve application uptime to 99.9%.
- This demo will be focused on describing the Assessment and Migration of source Server, Applications and Databases on Azure cloud. With enormous capability of **Azure Migrate**
    - Data Migration Assistant
        >- The Data Migration Assistant (DMA) helps you upgrade to a modern data platform by detecting compatibility issues that can impact database functionality in your new version of SQL Server or Azure SQL Database.
        >- DMA recommends performance and reliability improvements for your target environment and allows you to move your schema, data, and uncontained objects from your source server to your target server.

    - App Service Migration Assistant
        >- The Migration Assistant tool is a local agent that performs a detailed assessment and then walks you through the migration process.

### Before start the demo please prepare source infrastructure
# Setup source infrastructure on vCenter
**Prerequisites**
* Server on vCenter for template creation.
    > Note: create required server if not exist on vCenter by clicking on following name of the Server.
    * [Centos7](prerequisites/os/centos-template-creation.md)
    * [Ubuntu16](prerequisites/os/ubuntu-template-creation.md)
    * [Windows server 2016](prerequisites/os/windows-template-creation.md)

* Template for the server (linux, windows) where you want to install your application. ([Steps to create template](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/com.vmware.vsphere.vm_admin.doc/GUID-FE6DE4DF-FAD0-4BB0-A1FD-AFE9A40F4BFE.html))


* [Install terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) on server, from where you can access to your vCenter.
* After installing terraform, click on following server for terraform operation.
    * [linux server](terraform-scripts/linux/)
    * [windows server](terraform-scripts/windows/)
    
* After deployment of virtual machines user can [check](prerequisites/deployed-servers.md) running virtual machines on vCenter.

* For performing assessment and migration, user needs to [setup](prerequisites/appliance-setup.md) Azure Migrate Appliance on vCenter.
