# Azure Migrate
**Azure Migrate** provides a centralized hub to **assess** and **migrate** to Azure on-premises servers, infrastructure, applications, and data.
## Azure Migrate provides the following features:
* **Unified migration platform:** A single portal to start, run, and track your migration to Azure.
* **Range of tools:** A range of tools for assessment and migration. Tools include Azure Migrate: Server Assessment and Azure Migrate: Server Migration. Azure Migrate integrates with other Azure services and with other tools and independent software vendor (ISV) offerings.
* **Assessment and migration:** In the Azure Migrate hub, you can assess and migrate:
    * **Servers:** Assess on-premises servers and migrate them to Azure virtual machines.
    * **Databases:** Assess on-premises databases and migrate them to Azure SQL Database or to an Azure SQL Database managed instance.
    * **Web applications:** Assess on-premises web applications and migrate them to Azure App Service by using the Azure App Service Migration Assistant.
    * **Virtual desktops:** Assess your on-premises virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) and migrate it to Windows Virtual Desktop in Azure.
    * **Data:** Migrate large amounts of data to Azure quickly and cost-effectively using Azure Data Box products.

</kbd></p>

### **1. Lift & Shift**
“Lift and shift,” also known as “rehosting,” is the process of migrating an exact copy of an application or workload (and its data store and OS) from IT one environment to another-usually from on-premises to public or private cloud.

- This demo will be focused on describing the Assessment and Migration of source Server on azure cloud. With enormous capability of **Azure Migrate**
- we can assess server which has any types of database which are pointing to any web application and Migrate them using Azure Migrate Migration Tool.
- Before migration server assessment is done using
    - Azure Migrate: Server Assessment
        >- Discover installed applications, roles, and features with the Server Assessment tool in Azure Migrate.
- After assessment server migration is done using
    - Azure Migrate: Server Migration
        >- Migrate VM-Ware VMs, Hyper-V VMs, physical servers, other virtualized machines, and public cloud VMs to Azure.

### **2. App Modernization**
Modernization is all about transforming your legacy, monolithic applications into something more agile, more elastic, and with higher availability.
A modernized, cloud hosted application drastically reduces hardware and infrastructure cost and at the same time can improve application uptime to 99.9%.
- This demo will be focused on describing the Assessment and Migration of source Server, Applications and Databases on Azure cloud. With enormous capability of **Azure Migrate**
    - Data Migration Assistant
        >- The Data Migration Assistant (DMA) helps you upgrade to a modern data platform by detecting compatibility issues that can impact database functionality in your new version of SQL Server or Azure SQL Database.
        >- DMA recommends performance and reliability improvements for your target environment and allows you to move your schema, data, and uncontained objects from your source server to your target server.

    - App Service Migration Assistant
        >- The Migration Assistant tool is a local agent that performs a detailed assessment and then walks you through the migration process.
