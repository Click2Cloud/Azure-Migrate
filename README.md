    - Azure Migrate
- we can assess server which has any types of database which are pointing to any web application and Migrate them using Azure Migrate Migration Tool.
- Before migration server assessment is done using
    - Azure Migrate: Server Assessment

- After assessment server migration is done using
    - Azure Migrate: Server Migration
        >- Migrate VMware VMs, Hyper-V VMs, physical servers, other virtualized machines, and public cloud VMs to Azure.

### 2. App Modernization
- This demo will be focused on describing the Assessment and Migration of source Server, Applications and Databases on Azure cloud.
- With enourmous capability of
    - Azure Migrate
    - Data Migration Assistant
        >- The Data Migration Assistant (DMA) helps you upgrade to a modern data platform by detecting compatibility issues that can impact database functionality in your new version of SQL Server or Azure SQL Database.
        >- DMA recommends performance and reliability improvements for your target environment and allows you to move your schema, data, and uncontained objects from your source server to your target server.

    - App Service Migration Assistant
        >- The Migration Assistant tool is a local agent that performs a detailed assessment and then walks you through the migration process.
